#How to navigate through different activities

Intent is like an envelope in android to send message and call it can also use to jump from one activity to another.

Intent can save you from invent wheels, like you can use google map app to help you get the geo location.

Past code for reference usually in onclick method
{% highlight ruby %}
 Intent intent = new Intent(getActivity(), DetailActivity.class)
                        .putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, forecast);
                startActivity(intent);
{% endhighlight %}
